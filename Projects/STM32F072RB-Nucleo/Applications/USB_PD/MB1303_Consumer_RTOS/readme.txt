@par Application Description
Use of the USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) consumer application running on STM32F072+STUSB1602 devices.
Project configuration is based on USB Power Delivery Specification revision 2.0, with support of Consumer application on Port 0.

At startup:
 - Status LED (Blue LED D106) is on.
 - Role LED (Blue LED D100) blinks twice meaning that the board is acting the consumer role.
 - CC LED (Orange LED D102) is off.
 - VBUS LED (Green LED D101) is off.

Because of the P-NUCLEO-USB002 acts the consumer role, the user can connect to port 0 receptacle an application 
which plays the provider role. When this happens:
 - Role LED (Blue LED D100) will continue to blink twice to show that the device behaves as a Consumer.
 - CC LED (Orange LED D102) will blink once if connected on CC1, twice if connected on CC2.
 - The STM32 MCU behaves as a Consumer (Sink mode),it waits for Power Capabilities message 
   from the attached provider. When a Source Capabilities message is received, the STM32 
   starts the evaluation of the received capabilities and check if one of the received power 
   objects can meet its power requirement. 
   While the communication is carried on, VBUS LED (Green LED D101) will blink.
   The STM32 shall send the Request message to request the new power level from the offered 
   Source Capabilities.
   Once the Explicit Contract is achieved (PS_Ready message received), VBUS LED VBUS LED (Green LED D101)is on to 
   indicate that the power contract was established.


The consumer role can be managed with two different supply options that correspond 
to two configuration settings:
- First option: The Consumer is supplied by the on-board STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC voltage regulator, 
  by mean of a USB Type-A to Mini-B cable plugged to the CN1 connector and then to a PC.
  If this is the case, on STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board, verify that the jumper JP1 is open, jumper JP5 (PWR) is closed on U5V 
  (fitting the pins 1-2), and jumper JP6 (IDD) is closed.
  On the expansion board, jumpers JP000, JP400 are opened.

- Second option: the Consumer is supplied by mean of the VBUS delivered by the Provider attached.
  If this is the case, on the STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board, verify that jumper JP1 is closed, jumper JP5 (PWR) closed on E5V
  (fitting the pins 2-3), and jumper JP6 (IDD) is closed.
  On the expansion board, jumpers JP000, JP400 are opened.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F072 devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with P-NUCLEO-USB002 kit made by STMicroelectronics STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC
    board and the expansion board RevB connected on top of CN7 and CN10 connectors. 
    The provided example can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - Connect the P-NUCLEO-USB002 kit to the a USB-C Power Delivery consumer attaching the
    USB typeC cable to the receptacle CN0 on the expansion board.
    To test this application, the MB1303_Provider_RTOS application can be used as a Provider.

  - STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC Set-up
      - SB48, SB49, SB62 and SB63 must be closed
      - SB13, SB14, SB15 and SB21 must be removed
      - R34 and R36 must be removed
      - JP5 Jumper must be connected to U5V.

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
  - Open the IDE toolchain 
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the application
