@par Application Description
Use of the USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) Dual Port application running on STM32F072 devices.

This application provides an example for managing both Port 0 and Port 1 simultaneously.
Project configuration is based on USB Power Delivery Specification revision 2.0.
Both ports are Dual-Role Power (DRP) ports, and behave independently.
User should plug the USB-C cable on the dedicated connector (Port 0: CN0 or Port 1: CN1).
When the application starts, each Port has Capability of operating as either a Source or Sink.
When connecting an USB-C Power Delivery device (source or sink) on a given port, application should 
be able to detect type of connected device, and adopt corresponding suitable role, in order to
trigger the power negotiation:
 - At start, Role LED (LED D203 for Port 0 and LED D200 for Port 1) will be blinking indicating
   Port role (blink three times indicating DRP Role).
 - User should plug the USB-C cable on the dedicated connector (CN0 for Port 0 and CN1 for Port 1).
 - When Port behaves as a Consumer (Sink mode), i.e. when connected to a Source device,
   it waits for Power Capabilities message from the attached provider.
   When a Source Capabilities message is received, the STM32 
   starts the evaluation of the received capabilities and check if one of the received power 
   objects can meet its power requirement.
   The STM32 shall send the Request message to request the new power level from the offered 
   Source Capabilities.
   Once the Explicit Contract established (PS_Ready) message received), 
   VBUS LED (LED D204 for Port 0 and LED D201 for Port 1) is on to indicate
   that the Power Contract was established.
 - When Port behaves as a Provider (Source mode), i.e. when connected to a Source device,
   it exchanges Power profiles with the connected device and waits for Power Request message 
   from the attached consumer.
   If the requested power can be met, the STM32 MCU shall send the Accept message followed 
   by PS_RDY message.
   Once the Explicit Contract established, VBUS LED (LED D204 for Port 0 and LED D201 for Port 1) is on to indicate that the 
   Power Contract was established.

 - When attached, and before Explicit contract is established, VBUS LED 
   (LED D204 for Port 0 and LED D201 for Port 1) will be blinking.
 - When attached, CC LEDs (LED D205 for Port 0 and LED D202 for Port 1) will blink once 
   if connected on CC1, twice if connected on CC2.
 - Role (Blue) LED (LED D203 for Port 0 and LED D200 for Port 1) will be blinking 
   twice each time, if device behaves as a consumer, 
   or will be blinking once each time, if device behaves as a provider.

 - When connected to an USB-C with DRP, the power role swap is supported. if Port 0, it could be triggered each time user button is pressed.

This application also embeds a Command Line Interface (CLI) feature, which allows user
to get status of Power Delivery application running on Port 0 and Port 1 and to interact
with application through a serial communication.
Please refer to UM2051 (Getting started with the STM32 Nucleo pack for USB Type-C and Power Delivery)
for more details on :
 - Boards configuration for allowing CLI use
 - HyperTerminal configuration
 - Available CLI command lines and parameters.
In this application, both ports (Port 0 and Port 1) could be accessed by CLI commands.

The system can manage two supply options for Port 0 and port 1, depending upon Role that Port will
take, after being connected to another device (either Provider or Consumer). 

- First option: System is supplied by the on-board STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC voltage regulator, 
  by mean of a USB Type-A to Mini-B cable plugged to the CN1 connector and then to a PC.
  On STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board, verify that the jumper JP1 is open, JP5 (PWR) closed on U5V 
  (fitting the pins 1-2), and JP6 (IDD) closed.
  On MB1257 expansion board, close the jumper related to the Provider Port (J500 for PORT_0).
  This setting allows to manage the VBUS on the selected port, starting from 
  the STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC USB PWR voltage (CN1 connector).
- Second option: System is equipped with an external board by power connector CN4:
  On the STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC board, the following jumper settings must be guaranteed: JP1 
  closed, JP5 (PWR) closed on E5V (fitting the pins 2-3), and JP6 (IDD) closed.
  On P-NUCLEO-USB001 expansion board, while the jumpers J500, JP501 are opened, 
  the jumper JP100 must be set according to the port chosen for supplying the system 
  (fit 2-3 for PORT_0 or 1-2 for PORT_1).
  In Provider case, this setting configuration will permit to the external power board to supply the entire 
  system and, particularly for the USB PD application, to offer a voltage level for the 
  VBUS of the port.
  In Consumer case, Consumer is supplied by mean of the VBUS delivered by the Provider attached 
  by the USB Type-C cable.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STM32F072 devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC
    board with P-NUCLEO-USB001 shield (RevB or RevC) connected on CN7 and CN10 connectors 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - Connect the STM32 Nucleo board to the USB-C Power Delivery consumer, provider or DRP through
    USB typeC cable to either CN0 or CN1 connectors in the X-NUCLEO shield.
    To test this application on Port 0 or Port 1, a 2nd board could be loaded with 
    the Consumer_RTOS application to be used as a Consumer (Sink), with 
    the Provider_RTOS application to be used as a Provider (Source) or with 
    the DRP_RTOS or DUAL_PORT_RTOS applications to be used as a DRP (Source or Sink).

  - STM32F072RB-Nucleo RevC Set-up
    - Note that some PCB rework is needed to use the P-NUCLEO-USB001 shield
      - SB48, SB49, SB62 and SB63 must be closed
      - SB13, SB14, SB15 and SB21 must be removed
      - R34 and R36 must be removed
      - JP5 Jumper must be connected to U5V.
